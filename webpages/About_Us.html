	<h1>About Us</h1>

	<h2>About This Tool</h2>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><i>Backend data processing</i></p>
<p>
How did we handle missing data points?<br>
By using a package within scikit-learn's regression function set, we 
used a polynomial regression to predict and replace the mising data points
from a number of different installations across the state. 
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;"><i>Interacting with PVWatts</i></p>
We used the PVWatts API for a lot of our user-facing coverage. For our calls
to PVWatts we used optimal panel installation and orientation conditions
to provide a reference point for what a "perfect" cell would achieve.<br>
</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><i>Acknowledgements</i></p>
<p>
This tool would not have been possible without the help of a number of people.
First, a huge thank you to the people with the University of Washington's Clean
Energy Institute, as well as Dave Beck and Kelly Thornton of the UW DIRECT program. 
Second, the people at the Alaska Center for Energy and Power, especially Chris Pike
and Michelle Wilber, who have been constant advisors on this project, and also worked
to collect the data for all of the solar installations used in this project.
<br><br>
We would also like to thank our financial sponsors for this project. Much of ACEP's
work has been financed by the Office of Naval Research, and the DIRECT program is
funded through the NSF. Without this support, this work would not have been possible.
<br><br>
We would also like to thank Alan North, of  
<a href="http://www.analysisnorth.com/">Analysis North</a>, who provided
inspiration for many of the graphics we used in this project. Also, thank you to
NREL and the PVWatts Dev Team for their tool, <a href="https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php">PVWatts</a>, 
which we used to provide a number of our reference points.
<br><br>
And finally, thank you for your use of this tool. We're glad you're here, and 
we hope you find this tool useful.<br>
--The ARCTIC Dev Team
