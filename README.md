**Development Team Members** - Ge Gu, Jon Onorato, Zhi Peng
**Advisory Team Members** - Christopher Pike, George Roe, Erin Whitney, Michelle Wilber

This project objective is to calculate a number of different parameters and metrics for solar panels distributed throughout the state of Alaska, and generate an interactive graphic that enables users to investigate the costs and benefits to solar in their area, as well as provide a means to investigate if their panels are underperforming expected performance.
